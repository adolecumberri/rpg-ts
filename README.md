# RPG-TS

RPG-TS is a TypeScript-based library specifically designed for creating and handling role-playing game (RPG) characters and their statuses. Built with a strong focus on customization and extensibility, RPG-TS provides a solid foundation for building advanced and complex RPG mechanics.

The library is structured around three core classes - `Character`, `Status`, and `StatusManager` which respectively represent a character, a status effect, and a mechanism for managing character statuses in the game context. With these classes, you can easily define characters, assign them various status effects, and control their interactions within the RPG framework.

## Key Features
- **Character Management:** Easily define and handle characters with an extensive set of properties.
- **Status Effects:** Introduce dynamic gameplay elements with a variety of status effects, ranging from buffs and debuffs to more complex statuses.
- **Effortless Integration:** The library's modular design allows it to be smoothly integrated into any RPG project.
